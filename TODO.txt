TODO:
* Separate the sections in the JSON file and label them



Edge cases:

* Class opens new seats
* Results have more than one page
* Sections are cancelled
* Class doesn't exist/not available


Things to consider:

* Should I search for all courses and store them in a big json file? Or individually?

* Even with JSON files, where am I going to store data from every day?

*  Will this data be stored in separate JSON file that will continuously update? Mongoose? MongoDB? 
	-> Maybe have General Class info JSON file that stays the same (only runs once/few times before a quarter) and have a separate one with all the updating seats with timestamps.

Done:

* (DONE) Obtain all the class codes (DONE)
